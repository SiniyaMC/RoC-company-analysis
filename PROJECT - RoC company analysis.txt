Project Title: RoC Company Analysis

Problem Statement:The objective of this project is to leverage advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques to perform an in-depth exploration and predictive analysis on the master details of companies registered with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). The AI-driven analysis aims to uncover hidden patterns, discover valuable insights into the company landscape, and forecast future registration trends. By applying cutting-edge AI algorithms, the study seeks to identify unique characteristics and relationships among registered companies, enabling a more sophisticated understanding of the business ecosystem in Tamil Nadu. The ultimate goal is to develop predictive models that can anticipate future company registrations and contribute to informed decision-making for businesses, investors, and policymakers.
